PWP

### Milestone 1 Feedback

&#10004; Correctly set up the git/GitHub/PhpStorm toolchain.

&#10004; Create the directory structure for the project as outlined.

&#10004; Define a purpose, audience, and goal for your project.

&#10004; Create one Persona for your proposed project.

&#10008; Create one Use Case for your proposed project, based on the Persona.

This is a good start, but the Use Case is missing. Please finish up the Use Case before getting started on Milestone 2a. I'd like to see a little more relevant detail in the Persona. I still don't know who this guy really is, or who your main target audience is supposed to be. Nice work with CSS. At the moment your Milestone 1 stands at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) due to the missing Use Case. Complete this and your Milestone 1 will pass at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)

#### Edits/Suggestions
- Your HTML code looks really good overall. The only tiny issue I see is the closing &lt;/html&gt; tag is incomplete. Nice work on CSS!

### Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
&#10004; Create a sitemap outlining the pages you plan to include in your PWP.

&#10008; Document a brief plan or strategy for your content that will support the overall purpose and goal of the site.

&#10004; Map out a simple interaction flow that details the steps a user must take to successfully use your site to acheive the goal.

&#10004; Create a mobile and desktop/laptop wireframe for each page layout.

Nice job on the wireframes. I'd like to know a little more about what you'd like to do with the images on the right side of the desktop layout.

My suggestion for your navigation menu on mobile is to have it hidden, and a toggle button that will either create a dropdown menu or a slideout menu from the side. Having that many links going across the top pf a phone screen probably won't fit very well.

Your sitemap only really needs to list this one page, since this is only a 1-page layout. Easy!

The interaction flow could be a little more clear, but I see what you're getting at.

I would like to see more detail in your content strategy. That would actually help me to better understand what you want to do with the images for instance. That way we can figure out the best way to develop that functionality. For example, is there a 3rd party plugin or Bootstrap component that would be a good option for this section?

- A simple contact form is a required component to PWP - so plan on adding one. We'll be using php and Swiftmailer for this.

- Your HTML looks good.

Your Milestone passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin development. Be careful with that Navbar, and talk to me about what you want to do with those images. Take a look at the default Bootstrap navbar (which we will be looking at in the next Bootstrap lecture).

### Milestone 2b Feedback
Take a look at the notes we went over below, and check in with me or Skyler this week. After some cleanup, you should be ready to deploy to ASO next week.

Your Milestone 2b passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)

#### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Fix directory structure: create index.php, css directory 
- add contact form
- clean up the html and CSS, a bit more styling for professional presentation
- move your custom stylesheet down after bootstrap css (after line 15)
- use grid system for footer info layout

Set up ASO Host:
- Go over https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/class-materials/php/email/, add composer.json and mailer.php
- enable shell access - chat live support and request them to enable this
- Add your public SSH key (CPanel, SSH Access)
- Add an email account, and add an email forwarder if you like :)
- Create a new deployment in PhpStorm that uploads to ASO, and upload your site there.
