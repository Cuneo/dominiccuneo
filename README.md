### Milestone 1 Feedback

&#10004; Correctly set up the git/GitHub/PhpStorm toolchain.

&#10004; Create the directory structure for the project as outlined.

&#10004; Define a purpose, audience, and goal for your project.

&#10004; Create one Persona for your proposed project.

&#10008; Create one Use Case for your proposed project, based on the Persona.

This is a good start, but the Use Case is missing. Please finish up the Use Case before getting started on Milestone 2a. I'd like to see a little more relevant detail in the Persona. I still don't know who this guy really is, or who your main target audience is supposed to be. Nice work with CSS. At the moment your Milestone 1 stands at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) due to the missing Use Case. Complete this and your Milestone 1 will pass at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/)

#### Edits/Suggestions
- Your HTML code looks really good overall. The only tiny issue I see is the closing &lt;/html&gt; tag is incomplete. Nice work on CSS!
